# MDN Docs dark theme

This is my __work in progress__ dark theme for the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) website.

## Current Version

[mdn-docs-dark-theme.user.css](https://github.com/subz390/mdn-docs-dark-theme/raw/main/mdn-docs-dark-theme.user.css)

## Changelog

#### 1.0.0
- initial release


## Current State

I use MDN Web Docs almost daily and maintain this dark theme to cover the most used areas of the website.  There are some areas that need implementing though, so don't expect this stylesheet to be a polished.

This is a living project however and I will continue to update into the forseeable future.
